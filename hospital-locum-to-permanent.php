			An increasingly popular offer from the Medline stable is the <strong>Medline Fusion Model</strong> in which a provider can transit from a Locum to Permanent position (also known as Temporary to Permanent placement).
		</p>

		<p>
			The decision to take on additional permanent staff is often difficult.  A hospital management may not be sure whether a recent surge in patient flow is likely to be temporary or long lasting.  Many hospital managers will tell you stories of periods when they recruited additional permanent staff to cope with an increase in patient traffic, only for the surge to fizzle out soon after the staff resumed.  Stuck with redundant staff, they now had to decide between a bloated wage bill, and firing otherwise good staff, with the financial and legal implications.  It is a classic catch 22 situation.  The flip side is no better.  You employ a doctor after a short interview, only to realise a few weeks down the road that he is clinically deficient, or cannot fit in with the system in place. 
		
			 <ul>
			 		
			 		<p>
			 			The Medline Fusion Model for permanent placement solves this problem before it even starts.  In this arrangement, a medical facility takes on a doctor as a locum tenens provider for a while, usually a few months, either to properly access his suitability for a permanent position, or to see if the system really needs the extra hand. If the answer to either of these questions is in the negative, the hospital may just allow the locum contract to expire, and it doesn't have any financial or legal issues to contend with. The management can repeat the cycle as often as it wants until it is sure of the issues and take a firm decision. It is like having a working interview, before you commit yourself.  If you decide to make a permanent offer, Medline takes care of all the fine print, the facility just pays a placement fee, and there are no other financial or legal issues to contend with.  .  Furthermore, the permanent placement fee is discounted significantly depending on the extent of the locum tenens assignment by cutting the permanent fee up to 75%.

			 		<p>
			 			Our <strong>Medline Fusion Model</strong> for Permanent Placement is a robust business model designed to do two things well.  One, increase the probability of finding the right fit during the recruitment process.  Two, improve retention rates once a long term commitment is affirmed.
			 		</p>

			 </ul>
		</p>


	<p>
		This model, because it incorporates a “try before you buy” approach, increases your ability to experience more candidates to ensure an adequate fit, ultimately leading to higher retention rates
	
		<ul>
			<p>Client hospitals have learned that the ability to work with a doctor on a temporary basis prior to offering them a permanent contract is crucial to improving overall productivity. This "test-drive" scenario is an excellent option for the provider as well as the hiring organization and makes the transition to a new practice more seamless. It allows for both parties to willingly commit to each other, which makes for a more positive workplace environment leading to overall placement success.</p>
		</ul>

	</p>

	<p>That is the Medline Advantage. </p>
