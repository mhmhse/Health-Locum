						As a doctor new in town, just relocating, or just looking for new opportunities, there may be many tempting offers, and you are procrastinating, not sure which is the best offer. A Medline Locum to Permanent arrangement offers the best of both worlds. We call it the <strong>Medline Fusion Model.</strong>  
					</p>

					<p>
						While working as a locum tenens provider, you have more than a ring side view of the facility and its inner workings and systems and be able to know if this is the place for you.  You are better equipped to make a decision. Not only that, you can bargain better, now that the management has seen your worth. Itâ€™s like a working interview, with you getting paid while you check out the facility before you commit yourself.  What is more, Medline Locum Agency will be there to help you through the labyrinth and complexity of an employment contract.  
					</p>

					<p>
						This "test-drive" scenario is an excellent option for the provider as well as the hiring organization and makes the transition to a new practice more seamless. It allows for both parties to willingly commit to each other, which makes for a more positive workplace environment leading to overall placement success.
					</p>
					
	<p>That is the Medline Advantage. </p>
