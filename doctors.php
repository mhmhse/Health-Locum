					<div class="page-header">The Medline Advantage</div>


					<p>
						
						Many doctors would have done some ad hoc locum assignments in the past, but it was uncoordinated, haphazard, and sometimes, the doctor is not aware of the opportunities out there, and gets short-changed.  One of Medline’s goals is to organise this area of staffing in the medical industry, for the benefit of both the hospital, who gets his temporary staffing needs met, and the doctor, who is able to put his skills to extra use.

					</p>
					</br>
				


					<p>
						Here are just a few reasons why medical professionals from across all specialties and career phases, from residency to retirement should not dismiss the idea of locum tenens.
					</p>



					<p>
						
						<ol>
							<li><strong>It is an excellent way to supplement your income.</strong></br>
								By registering with Medline, you become available to pick up locum assignments on your off duty days, when you are on leave or any spare time you have.  According to statistics the majority of physicians who choose to work locum tenens do so in order to supplement their income. Many doctors who may be employed by government, or who work in a private practice admit to picking up extra locums shifts on their days off or on weekends as a quick and easy way to earn extra cash to meet pressing financial obligations.
							</li>

							
							<li><strong>Locum tenens schedules with Medline offer unparalleled flexibility</strong></br>
								For many doctors, the flexibility in scheduling is one of the most appealing aspects of locum tenens. You can choose which assignments to take on and which to turn down. You can also choose your location and duration of the contract. It’s an ideal arrangement for someone who has other commitments outside of medicine, whether it is caring for kids or a loved one, preparing for exams, exploring other hobbies or for those who are just looking for a better life/work balance.  
							</li>

							
							<li><strong>It offers you the kind of flexibility you would never find in any permanent position</strong></br>
								Working as a locum tenens allows you to plan your schedule around important personal milestones, from family weddings to family vacations. You can create your calendar well in advance and take on positions or sign contracts that do not disrupt your personal plans.
							</li>



							<li><strong>Locums enjoy more patient time & less administrative work</strong></br>
								For many doctors, administrative work is the least appealing part of their job but most will reluctantly admit to it being a ‘necessary evil’.  Filling boring HMO forms, medical reports, supervising other staff, sometimes even accounting work.  Locums on the other hand, enjoy the ability to practice pure medicine and focus on caring for their patients without having to worry about administrative work or having to fill up loads of paperwork.
							</li>



							<li><strong>A great way to enrich your CV</strong></br>
								By taking up varying locum assignments in varying hospitals all over the country, you can quickly acquire a well rounded experience of various practice systems, hospital technologies, and be abreast of advances in medicine.
							</li>



							<li><strong>Best rates in the medical industry</strong></br>
								Because Medline is able to negotiate top rates with participating hospitals, our locum tenens doctors earn between 50% and 100% higher rates than the industry average.  Medline presents the best and easiest way to that extra cash we all like to have. 
							</li>



							<li><strong>Prompt payment.</strong></br>
								What is more?  Medline will credit your account within 5 working days of verification of your completed timesheet.  This is mostly well before we get reimbursed for the assignment by the hospital.
							</li>
