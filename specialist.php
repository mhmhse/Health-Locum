					<p>
						Being a Specialist in any field of medicine, your hard earned skills can get maximum mileage with Medline.  There is a high demand for your skills in many clinical settings in many medical facilities all over the country.  The needs vary from one day assignments, short term and long term locums, to just Call Cover.
					</p>

					<p>
						The ‘Call Cover only’ type of assignment, presents a unique way for specialists to make extra cash even while engaged elsewhere.  You can even earn money from multiple assignments simultaneously. 
					</p>

					<p>
						While working in your permanent job, you can provide call cover in one or more hospitals, either in off duty hours, weekends, or long periods of weeks or months.  You only need to be available if you are needed.  You earn cash just for being available, and you earn even more if you get called.  An exciting way to make money while you sleep!
					</p>


					<p>
						Specialists are also needed sometimes for single case, or one day assignments.  These earn top rates, and you can even get multiple assignments in a single day, especially for specialities that are rare or in high demand.
					</p>


				<!-- <p>
					It is usually necessary to utilize all types of medical staffing strategies in order to best cope with both the dearth of doctors and the changing practice preferences of today’s doctors.

					<div class="page-header">CALL ONLY ASSIGNMENTS</div>


					<p>
						In this novel service option, the hospital can request for a Consultant/Specialist cover in a particular specialty for a specific period.  The hospital is linked up to the required Specialist, who then is contracted to provide call duty cover.  The health care professional assigned is required to be available for telephone consultations for cases of a particular specialty, and must be within 60 minutes of the facility.  The consultant will be paid the call duty rate.  This only mandates him/her to be available on phone, provide phone consultations, and be available to report at the facility to see and treat patients within the time frame.  Once the Consultant is called to the facility, standard locum rates will apply.
					</p>


				
					<p>
					Call duty contracts can vary depending on the needs of the hospital.  Common formats include:

				<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
				  <li>Weeknight call duty:  From 4pm to 8am the next day</li>
				  <li>24 hour call duty:   From 8am to 8am the next day</li>
				  <li>Weekend call duty:  From 4pm on Friday, to 8am Monday morning</li>
				</ul>
					</p>


					<p>
						Various customised packages can be designed for our valued client hospitals</p>
					<p>
						
					<p>
						The call duty cover service takes care of that worry every hospital has when, an in-house or visiting Consultant is temporarily unavailable, or the facility just wants to fill that gap in the range of specialist services it has available for its patients.  The Medline Advantage!
