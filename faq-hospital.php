					<p></p>
					<p></p>
					</br>


					<p>
						
						<strong>After you contact Medline, </strong>
						we will arrange a consultation with you.  In our initial consultation, we learn about your staffing needs, your systems and procedures, and then get you registered as a client hospital. 
						</p>


					<P>
						<strong>Hospitals are required to sign an agreement with Medline, </strong>
						a sample of which can be viewed on our website. They are also encouraged to open an account with Medline with a credit balance. This speeds up provision of locum tenens providers, as the prepayment of search fees is bypassed. Facilities with accounts with Medline can get the doctors they need much faster.
					</P>


					<p>
						<strong>When you have an urgent staffing need, </strong>you just contact Medline by phone, text, or email, giving us   the provider's qualifications needed, the time frame, and a few other details like a brief description of the assignment.
					</p>


					<p>
						<strong>Next, we start our search process. </strong>
						Our strong database of physician information allows us to quickly access the potential pool of candidates available and reach them with news of your needs. We’ll then start presenting our candidates’ details to you, so you can choose the perfect match.
					</p>


					<p>
						<strong>Once a match is made, the contract and order confirmation is next.</strong>

					 A contract form which includes the details of the assignment and fees chargeable is sent to you, by email preferably. This is signed by both parties. 
					</p>

					</br>


					<h4 style="color:#1abc9c;">Leave the rest to us!  The required provider will be at your facility at the required date and time!</h4>

					<p>
						<strong>After the physician has completed his/her shift(s), </strong>
						the provider presents a timesheet for the client facility to sign.  This timesheet will be sent to Medline for payment of the provider after verification.  Fees on the order/contract form are due for payment as soon as the assignment is completed or at the end of every month, whichever comes earlier.
					</p>


					<p>
						<strong>Finally, we gather evaluations following each assignment for future referencing</strong>
						in order to create the best placement experience possible for you.
					</p>

					<h4 style="color:#1abc9c;">Is it that easy ?</h4>

					<p>
						<strong>Yeah! It’s that easy.</strong>
						We get the required doctor or specialist travelling, working and providing the best service for you and your patients. We handle all of the details for you and the doctor. We even proactively let you know about future permanent and locum tenens candidates if you wish. Medline is committed to presenting a premium pool of highly-qualified doctors and creating valuable relationships that work for your practice and your patients.
					</p>

				
					<h4 style="color:#1abc9c;">How fast can you get me a Locum Doctor ?</h4>

					<p>
						<strong>As fast as you want! </strong>
						Obviously the longer the notice, the better for us and the easier it is to get a perfect match.  Standard searches require a minimum of 7 days.  Premium charges will apply for more urgent searches. Emergency requests of a few hours can be met, depending on the specialty.  Give us a call and we will take up the challenge.
					</p>


					<h4 style="color:#1abc9c;">How much does your service cost ?</h4>


					<p>Fees are negotiated depending on the grade and specialty. There are standard rates for : </p>

						<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
							  <li>Medical Officers/Registrars</li>
							  <li>Senior Medical Officers/ Senior Registrars</li>
							  <li>Consultants/Specialists</li>
						 </ul>

					<p>Fees are calculated hourly and requests are taken by shifts. A standard day shift lasts 8 hours.  A standard night shift is 12 hours.  Night shift rates are about half of a day shift.  Customised packages can be designed for our valued client hospitals.</p>

					<p>“Call only” packages are also available for hospitals that require Specialist cover in various specialties.  See the article on “Call only” packages</p>

					<p>For more details, contact our Client Service Consultants.    </p>

					<h4 style="color:#1abc9c;">Why does a Hospital need to have an account with Medline ?</h4>

					<p>
						<strong>It is optional, but advisable.  </strong>
						There is an initial nominal search fee which needs to be prepaid for any locum request.  From as little as N5,000, but is it is a requirement before any request is acted on.  Arranging payments at the time of requests with obviously cause delays.  With an account, which you can view on our website, your requests get us acting immediately.  Facilities with an account also enjoy credit facilities which can be invaluable in an emergency. More details from our Client Services officers. 						
					</p>



					<p>
						<strong>WHAT IS A CANCELLATION CHARGE?</strong>
						
					Occasionally, a facility cancels a request after a contract has been signed, but before the assignment starts, for whatever reason.  In such circumstances, the agency and provider would have incurred costs in preparing for the assignment.  A cancellation charge will be appropriate, and the amount will be stipulated in the contract.  Once an assignment has started however, other rules will apply.  See the terms and agreement page for details.
					</p>


					<p>
						<strong>How can I get started?</strong>
						If Medline sounds like a good fit for your practice, please contact us by phone or email, or better still, fill the enquiry form on our website to arrange a consultation.
