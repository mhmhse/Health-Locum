					<p>
						
						Healthcare facilities and medical practices nationwide are functioning in an environment that requires flexibility and creativity when it comes to implementing clinical staffing plans. In an era of physician and other provider shortages, comprehensive, multi-layered staffing plans which incorporate numerous types of resources are required to meet ongoing staffing challenges. 

						</br>
Such plans help organizations address:


<ul  style="list-style-type:disc">
		
		<li>Growing shortage of healthcare professionals nationwide</li>
		<li>Evolving nature of clinical practice</li>
		<li>Changing patterns of patient load as a result of healthcare reforms</li>
</ul>

which will likely create increased access to care for tens of millions of Nigerians through public, company, and private health insurance schemes.


					</p>


					</br>
					<p>
						Among the strategies many organizations are incorporating into their staffing plans is the use of locum tenens professionals 
“Locum tenens” is Latin for “holding a place” and is now a commonly used term in healthcare staffing circles when referring to physicians, dentists and advanced practice healthcare professionals who work temporary assignments. Today, healthcare facilities and practices are using locum tenens personnel for:
					
							
		<ul  style="list-style-type:disc">
				
				<li>Call-only coverage.</li>
				<li>Fill in for vacancies lasting a few days to a few months (sometimes longer) from sick, annual, maternity, academic or similar leaves of absence.</li>
				<li>Changing patterns of patient load as a result of healthcare reforms.</li>
				<li>Test the need for a new doctor, specialty or service within a hospital as part of an expansion plan.</li>
				<li>Help cope with temporary surges in patient flow.</li>
		</ul>
</p>

	</br>
<p>
The potential benefits of locum tenens include:

					
		<ul  style="list-style-type:disc">
				
				<li>Continuity of quality care.</li>
				<li>Forestalling patient migration to other facilities.</li>
				<li>Continuation of revenue streams during key vacancies.</li>
				<li>Reduced strain on permanent staff, increasing morale and decreasing turnover.</li>
				<li>Cost effectiveness when strategically employed.</li>
		</ul>

</p>

			</br>
			<p>
<strong>Today’s Staffing Plans: Multi-Layered</strong>	</br>

Personnel shortages, evolving practice styles and shrinking revenue have caused many healthcare facility administrators to adopt multi-layer staffing strategies. For example, many Medline client hospitals are combining various innovative staffing models into their overall staffing plans, including:

		<ul  style="list-style-type:disc">
				
				<li>Permanent doctors.</li>
				<li>Locum tenens doctors.</li>
				<li>In-house specialists.</li>
				<li>Part-time locum specialists.</li>
				<li>‘Call only’ specialist cover.</li>
		</ul>

</p>

					</br>
				<p>
					It is usually necessary to utilize all types of medical staffing strategies in order to best cope with both the dearth of doctors and the changing practice preferences of today’s doctors.  By using a variety of practice models, health facilities can ensure patients have high quality healthcare, team members remain satisfied, quality of care remains high, and revenue keeps flowing.
