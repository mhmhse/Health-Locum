					<p>
						In this novel service option, the hospital can request for a Consultant/Specialist cover in a particular specialty for a specific period.  The hospital is linked up to the required Specialist, who then is contracted to provide call duty cover.  The health care professional assigned is required to be available for telephone consultations for cases of a particular specialty, and must be within 60 minutes of the facility.  The consultant will be paid the call duty rate.  This only mandates him/her to be available on phone, provide phone consultations, and be available to report at the facility to see and treat patients within the time frame.  Once the Consultant is called to the facility, standard locum rates will apply.
					</p>


				
					<p>
					Call duty contracts can vary depending on the needs of the hospital.  Common formats include:

				<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
				  <li>Weeknight call duty:  From 4pm to 8am the next day</li>
				  <li>24 hour call duty:   From 8am to 8am the next day</li>
				  <li>Weekend call duty:  From 4pm on Friday, to 8am Monday morning</li>
				</ul>
					</p>


					<p>
						Various customised packages can be designed for our valued client hospitals</p>
					<p>
						
					<p>
						The call duty cover service takes care of that worry every hospital has when, an in-house or visiting Consultant is temporarily unavailable, or the facility just wants to fill that gap in the range of specialist services it has available for its patients.  The Medline Advantage!
