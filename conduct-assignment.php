<p>
Medline Locum Agency expects that all Providers will perform their locum tenens assignments in accordance with the agreed to terms including full coverage for all agreed to dates of service. In the event a provider needs to modify an accepted assignment, providers are required to provide 30 days written notice to modify or cancel a confirmed assignment. Medline Locum Agency realizes that emergencies occur, so in such a situation, please notify your Nationwide Locum Tenens representative as quickly as possible to see what accommodations can be made to meet both the needs of the provider and the client. The agreement between Medline Locum Agency, and each provider contains what is called a "non-compete" provision. This provision is standard in the locum tenens staffing industry and generally provides that once a provider works for, or is introduced to a client through Medline Locum Agency, the provider agrees that he/she will not work for that client for a specified period of time unless it is through Medline Locum Agency. The clients agree to a similar provision whereby the client agrees not to hire a provider to work for that client for a specified period of time unless it is through Medline Locum Agency. This restriction stays in place for any provider who works or is presented to a client via CV or otherwise for a period of 2 years following the termination of the provider's locum tenens contract with Medline Locum Agency. There are numerous situations where a provider and client want to convert the locum tenens arrangement into a permanent employment situation. Medline Locum Agency is always pleased when an assignment works out so favourably for both parties. In these situations, Medline Locum Agency will work out the necessary details with the client at no expense to the provider. This usually involves the payment of a placement fee.
